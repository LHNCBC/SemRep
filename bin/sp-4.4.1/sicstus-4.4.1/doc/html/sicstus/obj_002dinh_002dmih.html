<h4 class="subsubsection">10.23.3.2 Multiple Inheritance</h4>

<p>It is possible for a class to be defined with more than one
superclass. Because the class inherits properties from multiple
superclasses, this is referred to as multiple inheritance.
</p>
<p>Multiple inheritance is a complex and controversial topic. What should
be done about conflicting slot or method definitions? (This is
sometimes called a &ldquo;name clash.&rdquo;) What should be done about slots that
are inherited from two or more superclasses, but that originate with
a common ancestor class? (This is sometimes called &ldquo;repeated
inheritance&rdquo;.) Different systems take different approaches.
</p>
<p>SICStus Objects supports multiple inheritance in a limited but still
useful way. It does not allow repeated inheritance, and it places all
the responsibility for resolving name clashes on the programmer. This
section describes the multiple inheritance features of SICStus
Objects.
</p>
<a name="Class-Definitions-1"></a>
<h4 class="subheading">Class Definitions</h4>


<p>The definition of a class with multiple superclasses begins with a
<code>class/1</code> directive of the form
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">:- class <var>ClassName</var> = [<var>SlotDef</var>, <var>&hellip;</var>] + <var>SuperClass</var> + <var>&hellip;</var>.
</pre></div>


<p>The list of slot descriptions and the superclasses to the right of the
&lsquo;<samp>=</samp>&rsquo; can appear in any order, without changing the class being
defined. In fact, the slot descriptions can be partitioned into more
than one list, without changing the class. However, it is best to
adopt a fairly simple style of writing class definition
and use it consistently.
</p>
<p>Just as the slot names in a list of slot descriptions must be distinct, superclass names should not 
be repeated.
</p>
<a name="Slots-2"></a>
<h4 class="subheading">Slots</h4>


<p>In SICStus Objects, the programmer has no control over multiple
inheritance of slots. All slots from all superclasses are
inherited. And, the superclasses should have no slot names in common.
</p>
<p>As a consequence, in SICStus Objects no superclasses of a class should
have a common ancestor. The only exception would be the unusual case
where that common ancestor has no slots.
</p>
<a name="Methods-2"></a>
<h4 class="subheading">Methods</h4>



<p>By default, all methods are inherited from all superclasses. Any of
the superclasses&rsquo; methods can be uninherited, as described earlier, by
using the <code>uninherit/1</code> directive.
</p>
<p>If the same message is defined for more than one superclass, however,
then you must choose at most one method to inherit for the message. You may
choose none. You may do this by defining a new method for the message
(shadowing the superclasses&rsquo; methods), or by using the <code>uninherit/1</code>
directive, or by using the <code>inherit/1</code> directive.
</p>
<p>The following is considered a classic example of multiple inheritance.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">:- class toy.             % no slots in this class

Self &gt;&gt; size(small).

Self &gt;&gt; rolls(false).

:- end_class toy.

:- class truck.         % no slots in this class
        
Self &gt;&gt; size(large).

Self &gt;&gt; rolls(true).

:- end_class truck.
</pre></div>


<p>The idea expressed in these definitions is that most toys are small
and do not roll.  On the other hand, most trucks are large, but they do
roll. A toy truck shares one feature with each class, but we can
hardly expect a compiler to choose the correct one.
</p>
<p>The definition of a new class, toy_truck, might begin with
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">:- class toy_truck = toy + truck.
</pre></div>


<p>Rather than redefine the get methods for <code>size</code> and <code>rolls</code>, we can
specify which to inherit in two ways. One way is positive, stating
which to inherit, and the other way is negative, stating which not to
inherit.
</p>
<p>The positive version would be
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">:- inherit
        toy &gt;&gt; (size/1), 
        truck &gt;&gt; (rolls/1).
</pre></div>


<p>This is more convenient when a message is defined in several
superclasses, because all but the chosen method are uninherited. And,
it is probably easier to understand.
</p>
<p>The negative version would be
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">:- uninherit 
        toy &gt;&gt; (rolls/1), 
        truck &gt;&gt; (size/1).
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>toy_truck</code> class would exhibit the same behavior with either
definition.
</p>
<p>It is possible to define methods that access the shadowed or
uninherited methods of the superclasses, by sending the message to
the superclasses. In the case of multiple inheritance, however, it may
be necessary to specify which superclass to send the message to.
</p>
<p>The <code>toy_truck</code> class, for example, might define these methods:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Self &gt;&gt; uninherited_size(S) :- 
        super(truck) &gt;&gt; size(S).

Self &gt;&gt; uninherited_rolls(R) :-
        super(toy) &gt;&gt; rolls(R).
</pre></div>


<p>They provide access to the unchosen methods from <code>toy_truck</code>&rsquo;s superclasses. 
</p>
<p>While these examples with the toy_truck class are clearly &ldquo;toy&rdquo;
examples, the same techniques can be used in more realistic cases.
</p>
<a name="Abstract-and-Mixin-Classes"></a>
<h4 class="subheading">Abstract and Mixin Classes</h4>


<p>While SICStus Objects only supports a limited form of multiple
inheritance, its facilities are sufficient for working with so-called
<em>mixin classes</em>.
</p>
<p>The idea is to construct similar classes by first defining a class
that contains the things the desired classes have in
common. Typically, this will be an <em>abstract class</em>, which will have no
instances itself. Then, provide the features that differentiate the
desired classes with a set of mixin classes
</p>
<p>Mixin classes that have nothing in common can safely be mixed
together, to build the desired classes. The mixin classes will usually
be abstract classes, also, because they are too specialized for their
instances to be useful on their own.
</p>
<p>The date_stamp class defined earlier would make a good mixin class. A
similar <code>time_stamp</code> class might be (partially) defined as follows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">:- class time_stamp = 
        [hour:integer, 
         minute:integer, 
         second:integer].

Self &lt;- create :-
        time(time(Hour, Minute, Second)), 
        store_slot(hour, Hour), 
        store_slot(minute, Minute), 
        store_slot(second, Second).
</pre></div>


<p>Another mixin class might be used to &ldquo;register&rdquo; objects in the Prolog
database.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">:- class registry = [name:atom].

Self &lt;- create(Name) :-
        Self &lt;&lt; name(Name), 
        assert(registered(Name, Self)).

Self &lt;- destroy :-
        Self &gt;&gt; name(Name), 
        retract(registered(Name, Self)).
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>registry</code> mixin class could have been used with the <code>point</code>
class to define the <code>named_point</code> class, which was an example from
an earlier section.
</p>
<p>The ability to send a message to an object&rsquo;s superclass is useful when
working with mixin classes. Suppose the definition of a new class
begins with
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">:- <var>NewClass</var> = <var>OldClass</var> + date + time + registry.
</pre></div>


<p>where <var>OldClass</var> is some previously defined class that lacks the
features provided by the <code>date</code>, <code>time</code> and <code>registry</code>
classes. (In fact, they should not have any slot names in common.)
Then its create method can be defined by
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Self &lt;- create(Name) :-
        super(OldClass) &lt;- create, 
        super(date) &lt;- create, 
        super(time) &lt;- create, 
        super(registry) &lt;- create(Name).
</pre></div>


<p>This avoids the need to duplicate the code in the create methods of
OldClass and all three mixin classes.
