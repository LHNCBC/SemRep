<h3 class="section">5.1 The Procedure Box Control Flow Model</h3>
<a name="index-procedure-box"></a>
<a name="index-box_002c-procedure"></a>

<p>During debugging, the debugger prints out a sequence of goals in
various states of instantiation in order to show the state the
program has reached in its execution.  However, in order to
understand what is occurring it is necessary to understand when and why
the debugger prints out goals.  As in other programming languages,
key points of interest are predicate entry and return, but in
Prolog there is the additional complexity of backtracking.  One of
the major confusions that novice Prolog programmers have to face is the
question of what actually happens when a goal fails and the system
suddenly starts backtracking.  The Procedure Box model of
Prolog execution views program control flow in terms of movement
about the program text.  This model provides a basis for the
debugging mechanism in development systems, and enables the user
to view the behavior of the program in a consistent way.
</p>
<p>Let us look at an example Prolog predicate :
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">           *--------------------------------------*
   Call    |                                      |    Exit
---------&gt; +  descendant(X,Y) :- offspring(X,Y).  + ---------&gt;
           |                                      |
           |  descendant(X,Z) :-                  |
&lt;--------- +     offspring(X,Y), descendant(Y,Z). + &lt;---------
   Fail    |                                      |    Redo
           *-------------------+------------------*
                               |
&lt;------------------------------+
   Exception
</pre></div>

<a name="index-port-debugger"></a>
<a name="index-debugger_002c-port"></a>

<p>The first clause states that <var>Y</var> is a descendant of <var>X</var> if
<var>Y</var> is an offspring of <var>X</var>, and the second clause states
that <var>Z</var> is a descendant of <var>X</var> if <var>Y</var> is an offspring of
<var>X</var> and if <var>Z</var> is a descendant of <var>Y</var>.  In the diagram a box
has been drawn around the whole predicate and labeled arrows
indicate the control flow in and out of this box.  There are five such
arrows, which we shall look at in turn.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><var>Call</var></dt>
<dd><p>This arrow represents initial invocation of the predicate.  When a
goal of the form <code>descendant(X,Y)</code> is required to be
satisfied, control passes through the <var>Call</var> port of the
descendant box with the intention of matching a component clause
and then satisfying the subgoals in the body of that clause.
Note that this is independent of whether such a match is possible;
i.e. first the box is called, and then the attempt to match takes
place.  Textually we can imagine moving to the code for descendant when
meeting a call to descendant in some other part of the code.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>Exit</var></dt>
<dd><p>This arrow represents a successful return from the predicate.
This occurs when the initial goal has been unified with one
of the component clauses and the subgoals have been satisfied.
Control now passes out of the <var>Exit</var> port of the descendant
box.  Textually we stop following the code for descendant and go back to
the place we came from.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>Redo</var></dt>
<dd><p>This arrow indicates that a subsequent goal has failed and that
the system is backtracking in an attempt to find alternatives to
previous solutions.  Control passes through the <var>Redo</var> port of
the descendant box.  An attempt will now be made to resatisfy one of the
component subgoals in the body of the clause that last
succeeded; or, if that fails, to completely rematch the original
goal with an alternative clause and then try to satisfy any
subgoals in the body of this new clause.  Textually we
follow the code backwards up the way we came looking for new ways of
succeeding, possibly dropping down on to another clause and
following that if necessary.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>Fail</var></dt>
<dd><p>This arrow represents a failure of the initial goal, which might
occur if no clause is matched, or if subgoals are never satisfied,
or if any solution produced is always rejected by later processing.
Control now passes out of the <var>Fail</var> port of the descendant
box and the system continues to backtrack.  Textually we move back
to the code that called this predicate and keep moving backwards
up the code looking for choicepoints.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>Exception</var></dt>
<dd><p>This arrow represents an exception that was raised in the initial
goal, either by a call to <code>throw/1</code> or
<code>raise_exception/1</code> or by an error in a built-in predicate.
See <a href="ref_002dere.html#ref_002dere">ref-ere</a>.  Control now passes out of the <var>Exception</var>
port of the descendant box and the system continues to pass the
exception to outer levels.  Textually we move back to the code that
called this predicate and keep moving backwards up the code
looking for a call to <code>catch/3</code> or <code>on_exception/3</code>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>In terms of this model, the information we get about the procedure box
is only the control flow through these five ports.  This means that at
this level we are not concerned with identifying the matching clause,
and how any subgoals are satisfied, but rather we only wish to know
the initial goal and the final outcome.  However, it can be seen that
whenever we are trying to satisfy subgoals, what we are actually doing
is passing through the ports of <em>their</em> respective boxes.  If we
were to follow this, then we would have complete information about the
control flow inside the procedure box.
</p>
<a name="index-invocation-box"></a>
<a name="index-box_002c-invocation"></a>
<p>Note that the box we have drawn round the predicate should really
be seen as an <em>invocation box</em>.  That is, there will be a different
box for each different invocation of the predicate.  Obviously,
with something like a recursive predicate, there will be many
different <var>Calls</var> and <var>Exits</var> in the control flow, but these
will be for different invocations.  Since this might get confusing each
invocation box is given a unique integer identifier.
</p>
<p>In addition to the five basic ports discussed above, there are two
more ports for invocations involving a blocked goal:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><var>Block</var></dt>
<dd><p>This port is passed through when a goal is blocked.
</p></dd>
<dt><var>Unblock</var></dt>
<dd><p>This port is passed through when a previously blocked goal is unblocked.
</p></dd>
