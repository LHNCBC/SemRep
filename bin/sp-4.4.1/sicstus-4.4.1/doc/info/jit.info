1 Introduction
**************

The SICStus Prolog Just-In-Time Compiler (_SPJIT_) is currently
operational on the 'x86' and 'x86_64' architectures under Windows, Mac
OS X and Linux, and is being ported to the 'PPC64' (Power8) architecture
under Linux.  SPJIT works entirely in-memory; generated native code is
never written to any files.  The unit of compilation is a Prolog
predicate.  The compilation is performed in two steps: (a) from WAM
(Warren Abstract Machine) to IR (intermediate representation), (b) from
IR to native code.  SPJIT thus consists of three modules:

  1. A WAM to IR translator, written in Prolog.  Goals of this module
     include to be target independent and to run in time linear in the
     size of the input.
  2. An IR to native code translator, written in C. This module
     obviously needs to be adapted to the specific target.  One source
     code version covers 'x86' and 'x86_64', whereas another one is
     being developed for 'PPC64'.
  3. A runtime system to support the native code, written in assembly
     language.  It also contains entry points when emulated code wants
     to call, continue to, or fail back to native code.  Conversely, it
     contains return points when native code wants to call, continue to,
     or fail back to non-native code, or for all kinds of exception
     handling.  This module also calls other parts of the runtime system
     as needed.  This module too obviously needs to be adapted to the
     specific target.  One source code version covers 'x86' and
     'x86_64', whereas another one is being developed for 'PPC64'.

2 Intermediate Representation
*****************************

The intermediate representation can be thought of as a universal
assembly language, or at least a language general enough to execute the
Prolog virtual machine if assisted by a runtime system.  In this
chapter, we list its instructions as well as their expansion into native
instructions.

   [PERM: It would be nice with some description of the abstract CPU. In
particular the condition codes and how they are maintained.]

================

In this report, the term _condition codes_ denotes conditions used by
conditional branches, including the overflow condition.

   On the x86/x86_64 architectures, operations such as 'add' set
overflow set iff the signed add yields an arithmetic overflow, and clear
it otherwise.  To achieve the same on PPC64, one must use the technique:

     <<clear XER>>
     addo. DEST,SRC1,SRC2

which first clears the XER register (see below), and 'addo.', in case of
an overflow, sets the SO flag of the XER. In either case, the overflow
condition is set to the resulting SO flag, reflecting the outcome of the
operation.  The SO flag can then be used for conditional branching and
the like.

   Clearing (the SO-bit of) the XER register can be achieved in many
ways.  We will clear the entire XER register, using the sequence:
     li 0,0
     mtxer 0

which first clears R0 and then moves that into the XER register.(1)

   Static branch prediction has not been exploited in this report, but
should.

   The following table shows the correspondence between IR condition
codes and conditional branch instructions.

3 Predicate Linkage
*******************

For the purposes of SPJIT, it is useful to think of three modes in which
a predicate P can be:

_jitex_
     P has been JIT compiled and does not have a breakpoint, block
     declaration or the like.  Calls from other _jitex_ predicates to P
     stay in native code.

_cex_
     P is implemented by a C function and does not have a breakpoint,
     block declaration or the like.  Calls from _jitex_ predicates to P
     go to the C function [PERM: "go to the C function" means what?
     Direcly (not via 'native_c'?  If so, how are
     breakpoints/redefinitions to C functions triggered when called from
     jitted code_].  Such predicates are never subject to JIT
     compilation.

_wamex_
     All other cases.  Calls from _jitex_ predicates to P are routed via
     the WAM emulator.  The transfer of control is implemented by
     returning from the JIT runtime system with the value 2.

   When SICStus starts, no _jitex_ predicates exist, but start to appear
as emulated predicates get JIT compiled.

   Note that setting a breakpoint on a _jitex_ predicate changes its
state to _wamex_.  Removing the breakpoint changes the state back to
_jitex_.  Redefining a _jitex_ predicate also changes its state to
_wamex_.

   For a predicate P whose 'struct definition *' pointer is 'def',
'def->jit' is either NULL or points at the JIT code generated for P,
whereas 'def->proc.native' contains a lead-in sequence of machine
instructions.  The JIT compiler translates a call from P to Q into a
call to Q's lead-in sequence, no matter what type of predicate Q is or
whether it is even defined.

   [PERM: Do 'mod_def.proxies' definitions need some special treatment?]

   If P is _jitex_, then the lead-in sequence calls the kernel
subroutine 'native_shunt_link', which patches the caller to directly
call the JIT code the next time around.  If P is _cex_, then the lead-in
sequence calls the kernel subroutine 'native_c', which routes the call
to the C function.  If P is _wamex_, then the lead-in sequence calls the
kernel subroutine 'native_nonjit', which arranges for the call to be
handled by the WAM emulator.

   If the state of P changes from _jitex_ to _wamex_, then a prefix of
'def->jit' is modified to an instruction sequence that calls the kernel
subroutine 'native_restore_link', which patches the caller to call the
lead-in sequence the next time around.

   If the state of P changes from _cex_ to _wamex_ because a breakpoint
was set, then 'def->jit' is not relevant (because such predicates are
not jitted).

   If the state of P changes from _wamex_ back to _jitex_ because a
breakpoint was removed, then the prefix of 'def->jit' is repaired to
contain the original JIT instructions for P.

   If P was first JIT compiled and then redefined, then 'def->jit'
cannot be freed entirely, because there may be dangling references to it
created by 'native_shunt_link'.  Thus, its prefix, which calls
'native_restore_link', must be preserved.  This small memory leak is not
expected to be noticeable in a production setting.

   The exact layout of these code sequences is back-end dependent and is
explained in the following sections.

For all modes, the prefix sequence is preceded by a single word

_Main Body_

     other predicates.
_TOC_
     An array of constants for loading instead of synthesizing, for
     cases where loading is faster.  A pointer to the TOC is maintained
     in 'toc' and is refreshed by the 'context(_)' IR instruction.
     Every TOC must begin with:
          toc+0  : native_shunt_link
          toc+8  : native_restore_link
          toc+16 : native_nonjit
          toc+24 : native_c
     In the lead-in sequence, the toc register is guaranteed to point at
     _some_ valid JIT-TOC, and thus contain the above four entries.

3.4 WAM-JIT Interface
=====================

In terms of the C call stack, the WAM emulator calls the JIT runtime
system, but the latter never calls the WAM emulator.  Recursive nesting
can only happen in the foreign language interface, if the foreign
function calls Prolog, and similarly in a predicate implemented as a C
function, if the C function calls Prolog.

   The WAM emulator has a general mechanism to dispatch on the predicate
type.  When it sees a _jitex_ predicate, it routes the call with call
site 'w->insn' and callee 'w->predicate' to the ABI function:
     int call_native(struct worker *w);

   The WAM instruction set has been extended by the special instruction
'NATIVE_OP', and it is legal for 'w->next_insn' to point to it, i.e., it
is a legal continuation.  As for all continuations, the half word
preceding it is the environment size field.  The word following it
points to the WAM code equivalent of the continuation, immediately
followed by the native code of the continuation.  When the WAM emulator
sees it, it routes the call with 'w->insn' pointing to it to the ABI
function:
     int proceed_native(struct worker *w);

   Both ABI function return the values:
0
     _jitex_ code backtracks into _wamex_ code.
1
     _jitex_ code proceeds to _wamex_ code at address 'w->insn', in read
     mode if 'x(0)' is nonvar and in write mode otherwise.
2
     _jitex_ code calls _wamex_ code with call site 'w->insn' and callee
     'w->predicate'.
3
     _jitex_ code proceeds to the WAM instruction 'PROGRESS'.

4.1 Placement of WAM and IR Registers
=====================================

The "WAM registers" 'arg0..arg2' are for passing parameters from the JIT
code to the runtime system.  These "WAM registers" must be preserved by
the machine code that implements the IR instructions (i.e. the generated
machine code must not used any of 'arg0..arg2' as scratchpad registers).

   The "WAM registers" 'arg3..arg5' are scratchpad registers of the
runtime system and may also be freely used by the machine code that
implements the IR instructions.

   For x86_64, the exact offsets of 'ac0' and 'ac1' are ABI dependent
(Windows vs.  non-Windows).

   For PPC64, the 'CTR' register is used by 'context(_)' instructions,
in predicate-to-predicate calls, and for jumping to continuations.  The
link register is used in 'call' and 'ccall' instructions.  Otherwise,
'CTR' can be used freely, and so can the link register.  Additionally
'R0' and 'arg3..arg5' can be used freely by the machine code that
implements the IR instructions.

5 Runtime System
****************

The runtime system contains 140 subroutines, each of which is briefly
described in the following table.  The arguments and return values are
"typed" by the registers in which they are passed.  Many arithmetic
subroutines act on the accumulators 'ac0' and 'ac1', each of which can
be _unboxed_, i.e. contain a raw integer, or _boxed_, i.e. contain a
tagged pointer to a big integer or float, either on the global stack or
on a scratchpad area.  If both accumulators are live, then either both
are boxed or both are unboxed.

   The type 'cc' denotes a return value passed as a condition code, with
the following conventions:

'o'
     Signals an arithmetic overflow or other error.  Other condition
     codes are undefined.

'e' vs. 'ne'
     Continue in write mode vs.  read mode.  Other condition codes are
     undefined.

'e' vs. 'ne'
     Continue with unboxed accumulators vs.  boxed accumulators.  Other
     condition codes are undefined.

'e' vs. 'ne'
     Reflects the outcome of 'native_test_numbers()'; see below.  Other
     condition codes are undefined.

'e' vs. 'ne'
     Failure vs.  success of a type test.  Other condition codes are
     undefined.

'e', 'ne', 'l', 'le', 'g', 'ge'
     Reflects the outcome of a comparison.  Other condition codes are
     undefined.

   Following are the subroutines:

'void native_nonjit()'
     Handle general events as well as calls to non-_jitex_ predicates.

'void native_restore_link()'
     Patch the caller, which corresponds to an IR instructions of the
     form 'call(native_entry(M:F/A))', to call the lead-in sequence, and
     remake the call.  For x86/x86_64, this affects a 'call' machine
     instruction, in the main body or in a trampoline.  For PPC64, this
     never affects any machine instructions.  Only TOC slots are
     affected.

'void native_shunt_link()'
     Patch the caller, which corresponds to an IR instructions of the
     form 'call(native_entry(M:F/A))', to call the prefix sequence, and
     jump there.  For x86/x86_64, this affects a 'call' machine
     instruction, in the main body or in a trampoline.  For PPC64, this
     never affects any machine instructions.  Only TOC slots are
     affected.

'void native_get_constant(val Xj, arg1 C)'
     Unify 'Xj' with the constant 'C'.

     Unify 'Xj' with the constant 'C', where Xj occurs in compound term.

'cc native_get_sublist(val Xj)'
     Unify 'Xj' with a list, setting 's' if read mode, where Xj occurs
     in compound term.

'void native_get_subnil(val Xj)'
     Unify 'Xj' with the constant '[]', where Xj occurs in compound
     term.

'cc native_get_substructure(val Xj, arg1 F)'
     Unify 'Xj' with a structure with principal functor 'F', setting 's'
     if read mode, where Xj occurs in compound term.

'void native_get_value(val X, arg1 Y)'
     Unify 'X' and 'Y'.

'void native_bind(val X)'
     Trail the binding of X that just took place if necessary.

'void native_trail_unsafe(val X)'
     Trail local variable 'X' if needed, in the context of
     '*_unsafe_variable'.

'void native_make_global(val X)'
     Globalize variable X if needed.

'cc native_compareop(arg0 X, arg1 Y)'

'void native_fail()'
     Backtrack.

'void native_if()'
     Support for 'ANOP_IF'.

'void native_metacall(val Callee)'
     Support for a metacall to 'Callee'.

'void native_proceed()'
     Handle 'PROCEED', continuing into native code for 'NATIVE_OP'
     continuations.

'void native_progress()'

File: jit.info,  Node: System Properties Affecting the JIT Compilation,  Next: Configuration Options Affecting the JIT Compilation,  Up: Options Affecting Jitting

6.1.1 System Properties Affecting the JIT Compilation
-----------------------------------------------------

SP_USE_SHADOW_KERNEL (default 'yes')

     'sicstus -DSP_USE_SHADOW_KERNEL=no' turns off the use of "shadow"
     kernel, i.e.  the copies of the real kernel.  Turning it off is
     useful if you want to set breakpoints in gdb etc.  POWER only.

'SP_USE_XER' (default 'no')

     The default value for '', '' and ''.  POWER only.

'SP_USE_XER_ADDO'

     Whether the XER register should be used for overflow detection of
     'addo' IR-instruction on POWER.

'SP_USE_XER_SUBO'

     Whether the XER register should be used for overflow detection of
     'subo' IR-instruction on POWER.

'SP_USE_XER_MULO'

     Whether the XER register should be used for overflow detection of
     'mulo' IR-instruction on POWER.

'SP_DEBUG_TOC_LINK' (default 'no')

     Whether to print debug info about code/toc patching.  Ignored in
     release builds.  POWER only.

'SP_JIT_HUGE_BLOCK' (default 'yes')

     Whether a huge block, with a shadow kernel in the middle, should be
     pre-allocated for jitted code.  This is so that kernel calls from
     jitted code can use direct branches.

     The shadow kernel in the huge block will not be used if
     'SP_USE_SHADOW_KERNEL' is off.

'SP_JIT_STATS' (default 'no')

     Whether to ensure that 'prolog:'$jit_print_stats'/0' prints
     accurate statistics about emitted IR instructions.

     Turning it on will prevent re-use of jitted code between
     iterations.  This is why it is not enabled by default for debug
     builds.

'SP_JIT_ALIGN2' (default 'yes')

     Whether 'align 2' should align to a multiple of 32 (instead of
     being a no-op).  POWER only.

'SP_JIT_ALIGN3' (default 'no')

     Whether 'align 3' should align to 24 (modulo 32) (instead of
     aligning to 0 (modulo 8)).  POWER only.

     Do *not* turn it on, it will crash the system.

'SP_QUIET_JIT_FAIL' (default 'yes')

     'sicstus -DSP_QUIET_JIT_FAIL=no' will cause an assertion to trigger
     if jitting needs too many iterations (e.g.  it would not
     terminate).

'SP_SPTI_PATH=OPTION'

     Whether to load code that gets informed about jitting events.

     'sicstus -DSP_SPTI_PATH=perf' is allowed if '--enable-perf' was
     specified when configuring.  It will cause 'perf' data to be
     emitted.  This is enabled by default if 'sicstus' detects that it
     is started under 'perf'.

     The automatic enablement can be turned off 'sicstus
     -DSP_SPTI_PATH=none'.

     'sicstus -DSP_SPTI_PATH=opdis' is also possible, if
     '--enable-oprofile' was specified when configuring.


File: jit.info,  Node: Configuration Options Affecting the JIT Compilation,  Prev: System Properties Affecting the JIT Compilation,  Up: Options Affecting Jitting

6.1.2 Configuration Options Affecting the JIT Compilation
---------------------------------------------------------

'--enable-jit-lq-stq' (default disabled)

     Whether to use quad-word load and store instructions ('lq' and
     'stq') in the kernel and in jitted code.  POWER only.

'--enable-jit-preload-fail' (default disabled)

     Whether to preload JIT failure continuation.

'--enable-jit-fli' (default enabled on supported platforms)

     Whether to use JIT compilation.

'--enable-jit-fli' (default enabled on supported platforms)

     Whether to use JIT compilation of FLI predicates.  Ignored if JIT
     compilation is not enabled.

     This feature has not yet been implemented on POWER.

'--enable-jit-plcall-pass-cp-in-link' (default disabled)

     Whether to pass the Caller information in the link register.  If it
     is disabled then the information is passed in a register, or not at
     all.  POWER only.

'--with-opdis=PATH'

     The path to a OPDIS installation, e.g. '/usr/local/opdis'.  This is
     needed in order to get machine code disassembly while dumping
     IR-code.  Ignored unless '--enable-opdis' is also passed.

'--enable-opdis' (default disabled)

     Whether OPDIS should be used for disassembling machine code in
     debug output.

     OPDIS is supported on Linus, OS X and POWER. OPDIS itself needs to
     be modified to build on POWER.

     On OS X the path to binutils must be specified with
     '--with-binutils=PATH' on order to use OPDIS.

     Note: OPDIS must never be included in a released build.  Licencing
     issues.

'--enable-perf' (default disabled)

     Whether 'perf' should be supported, i.e.  so that jitted code can
     be disassembled and annotated by 'perf'.

     Supported on 64-bit Intel Linux and on (64-bit) POWER Linux.

'--enable-oprofile' (default enabled on Linux)

     Whether 'oprofile' should be supported.  Nowadays 'perf' is
     preferred.
