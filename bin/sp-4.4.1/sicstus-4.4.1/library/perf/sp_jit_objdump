# Pass this as --objdump argument to perf in order to make sense of the data written by SICStus.
#
# 1. Start sicstus within perf and with perf profiling support
#
#    $ perf record sicstus -DSP_SPTI_PATH=perf
#
#    Note: perf profiling may not work in virtual machines (VMWare,
#          VirtualBox, etc). That problem has nothing to do with
#          SICStus.
#
# 2. Do the thing in sicstus that you want profiled.
#
# 3. Exit sicstus (this is probably optional, currently).
#
# 4. Use perf report, perf annotate, etc. to present the results.
#
#    $ perf report --objdump=sp_jit_objdump
# or
#    $ perf annotate --objdump=sp_jit_objdump
#
# You may need to specify full paths to "sicstus" and "sp_jit_objdump"
#
# Specifying an objdump is not strictly neecessary. It is only needed
# if you want to annotate (i.e. show machine code) for the jitted
# code.
#
#
# Older versions of perf (prior to 3.10?) does not support the
# --objdump flag (but those versions may be to old to understand the
# profile data from the JIT, so the following workaround may be
# useless). A workaround is to create a copy or symbolic link of
# sp_jit_objdump called "objdump". Something like:
#
# Create a symbolic link, named "objdump", in its own directory. This
# way we can add that directory first to PATH, so its "objdump" is
# found before the perf version.
#
# ( mkdir tmp && cd tmp && ln -s $( sicstus --noinfo --nologo --goal "absolute_file_name(library('perf/sp_jit_objdump'), P), write(P),nl,halt." ) objdump )
#
# Then run perf report etc with a modified PATH:
#
# PATH="$PWD/tmp:$PATH" perf report
# 


# The perf-PID.map file, if present, is the last argument
file="${@: -1}"

: ${sp_real_objdump:=/usr/bin/objdump}

if [ "${file##*.}" = 'map' ]; then
  # file ends with ".map". Presumably it is ..../perf-PID.map. Extract the PID part.
  basename="$(basename "$file" '.map')" # remove directory and the .map suffix 
  pid="${basename##perf-}" # remove the "perf-" prefix
  # now verify that we really got a non-empty, non-negative, integer

    # Remove the last argument (the map file), that objdump does not
    # understand, before passing arguments to objdump
    #
    # We do this even if we will fall through to the fallback case
    # (since objdump do not understand the .map file anyway).

    if [ -n "$( find "$obj_dir"/ -maxdepth 1 -name "*.elf" -print -quit )" ]; then
      # Pass the original arguments (except the .map file) and all the
      # elf files to the real objdump.
      #
      # objdump will write empty lines and information about the
      # format of the argument files ("... file format
      # elf64-x86-64"). Filter away those lines.
