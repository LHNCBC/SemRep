This directory contains a random collection of more or less well-known
sample MiniZinc/FlatZinc programs. In most cases, but not always, the
code is attributed to its source.

The G12 sub directory contains example programs of the G12 MiniZinc
distribution. These examples are in the public domain, as of version
1.0 of the G12 MiniZinc distribution.
