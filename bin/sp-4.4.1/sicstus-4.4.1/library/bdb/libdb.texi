@chapter External Storage of Terms (External Database)

This library handles storage and retrieval of terms on files.  By using
indexing, the store/retrieve operations are efficient also for large
data sets.

The package is loaded by the query

@section Basics

The idea is to get a behavior similar to @code{assert/1},
@code{retract/1} and @code{clause/2} but the terms are stored on files
instead of in primary memory.

The differences compared with the internal database are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@cindex database
A @dfn{database} must be opened before any access and closed after the
last access. (There are special predicates for this: @code{db_open} and
@code{db_close}.)

@item
The functors and the indexing specifications of the terms to be stored
have to be given when the database is created. (@pxref{The DB-Spec}).

@item
The indexing is specified when the database is created.  It is possible
to index on other parts of the term than just the functor and first
argument.

@item
Changes affect the database immediately.

@item
The database will store variables with frozen goals as ordinary variables.
@end itemize

Some commercial databases can't store non-ground terms or more than one
instance of a term.  The SICStus database can however store terms of
either kind.

@node Current Limitations, Berkeley DB, Basics, Top
@section Current Limitations

@itemize @bullet
@item
The terms are not necessarily fetched in the same order as they were
stored.

@item
If the process dies during an update operation (@code{db_store},
@code{db_erase}), the database can be inconsistent.

@item
Databases can only be shared between processes running on the machine
where the environment is created (@pxref{Predicates}).  The database
itself can be on a different machine.

@item
The number of terms ever inserted in a database cannot exceed
@tex
$2^{32}-1$.
@end tex
@ifnottex
2**32-1.
@end ifnottex

@item
Duplicates are not handled efficiently by Berkeley DB.  This limitation
is supposed to get lifted in the future.  Duplicates can result from
indexing on non-key attribute sets, inserting terms with variables on
indexing positions, or simply from storing the same term more than once.
@end itemize

@node Berkeley DB, The DB-Spec Informal Description, Current Limitations, Top
@section Berkeley DB
This database library is an interface to the Berkeley DB toolset to
support persistent storage of Prolog terms.  Some of the notions of
Berkeley DB are directly inherited, e.g., the environment.

The interface uses the Concurrent Access Methods product of Berkeley DB.
This means that multiple processes can open the same database but
transactions and disaster recovery are not supported.

The environment and the database files are ordinary Berkeley DB entities
which means that the standard support utilities (e.g., @code{db_stat})
will work.

@section The DB-Spec---Informal Description

@cindex db-spec
The @dfn{db-spec} defines which functors are allowed and which parts of
a term are used for indexing in a database.  The syntax of a spec
resembles to that of the mode specification.  The db-spec is a list of
atoms and compound terms where the arguments are either @code{+} or
@code{-}.  A term can be inserted in the database if there is a spec in
the spec list with the same functor.

Multilevel indexing is not supported, terms have to be ``flattened''.

@cindex indexed term
@cindex term, indexed
Every spec with the functor of the @dfn{indexed term} specifies an
indexing.  Every argument where there is a @code{+} in the spec is
indexed on.

The idea of the db-spec is illustrated with a few examples.  (A section
further down explains the db-spec in a more formal way).

Given a spec of @code{[f(+,-), .(+,-), g, f(-,+)]} the indexing works
as follows.  (The parts with indexing are underlined.)

@example
@emph{Term}               @emph{Store}                      @emph{Fetch}

g(x,y)              domain error              domain error

f(A,B)              f(A,B)                    instantiation error
                    -

f(a,b)              f(a,b)  f(a,b)            f(a,b)
                    - -     -   -             - -

[a,b]               .(a,.(b,[]))              .(a,.(b,[]))
                    - -                       - -

g                   g                         g
                    -                         -
@end example

The specification @code{[f(+,-), f(-,+)]} is different from
@code{[f(+,+)]}.  The first specifies that two indices are to be made
whereas the second specifies that only one index is to be made on both
arguments of the term.

@section Predicates
@subsection Conventions
The following conventions are used in the predicate descriptions below.
@itemize @bullet
@item
@var{Mode} is either @code{update} or @code{read} or @code{enumerate}.
In mode @code{read} no updates can be made.  Mode @code{enumerate} is
like mode @code{read} but also indexing cannot be used, i.e., you can
only sequentially enumerate the items in the database.  In mode
@code{enumerate} only the file storing the terms along with their
references is used.

@item
@var{EnvRef} is a reference to an open database environment.  The
environment is returned when it is opened.  The reference becomes
invalid after the environment has been closed.

@item
@var{DBRef} is a reference to an open database.  The reference is
returned when the database is opened.  The reference becomes invalid
after the database has been closed.

@item
@var{TermRef} is a reference to a term in a given database.  The
reference is returned when a term is stored.  The reference stays valid
even after the database has been closed and hence can be stored
permanently as part of another term.  However, if such references are
stored in the database, automatic compression of the database (using
@code{db_compress/(2-3)}) is not possible, in that case the user has to
write her own compressing predicate.

@item
@var{SpecList} is a description of the indexing scheme,
@pxref{The DB-Spec}.

@item
@var{Term} is any Prolog term.

@item
@var{Iterator} is a non-backtrackable mutable object.  It can be used to
iterate through a set of terms stored in a database.  The iterators are
unidirectional.
@end itemize

@subsection The environment
To enable sharing of databases between process, programs have to create
@emph{environments} and the databases should be opened in these
environments.  A database can be shared between processes that open it
in the same environment.  An environment physically consists of a
directory containing the files needed to enable sharing databases
between processes.  The directory of the environment has to be located
in a local file system.

Databases can be opened outside any environment (see @code{db_open/4}),
but in that case a process writing the database must ensure exclusive
access or the behaviour of the predicates is undefined.

@subsection Memory leaks
In order to avoid memory leaks, environments, databases and iterators
should always be closed.  Consider using @code{call_cleanup/2} to
automate the closing/deallocation of these objects.  You can always use
the @code{db_current...} predicates to enumerate the currently living
objects.

@subsection The predicates
@table @code
@item db_open_env(@var{+EnvName}, @var{-EnvRef})
@itemx db_open_env(@var{+EnvName}, @var{+CacheSize}, @var{-EnvRef})
@findex db_open_env/2
@findex db_open_env/3
Opens an environment with the name @var{EnvName}.  A directory with this
name is created for the environment if necessary.  @var{EnvName} is not
subject to @code{absolute_file_name/2} conversion.

By using @code{db_open_env/3} one can specify the size of the cache:
@var{CacheSize} is the (integer) size of the cache in kilobytes.  The
size of the cache cannot be less than 20 kilobytes.
@code{db_open_env/2} will create a cache of the system's default size.

The size of the cache is determined when the environment is created and
cannot be changed by future openings.

A process cannot open the same environment more than once.

@item db_close_env(@var{+EnvRef})
@findex db_close_env/1
Closes an environment.  All databases opened in the environment will be
closed as well.  @code{abort/0} does not close environments.

@item current_env(@var{?EnvName}, @var{?EnvRef})
@findex current_env/2
Unifies the arguments with the open environments.  This predicate can be
used for enumerating all currently open environments through
backtracking.

@item db_open(@var{+DBName}, @var{+Mode}, @var{?SpecList}, @var{-DBRef})
@itemx db_open(@var{+DBName}, @var{+Mode}, @var{?SpecList}, @var{+EnvRef}, @var{-DBRef})
@findex db_open/4
@findex db_open/5
Opens a database with the name @var{DBName}.  The database physically
consists of a directory with the same name, containing the files that
make up the database.  If the directory does not exist, it is created.
In that case @var{Mode} must be @code{update} and the db-spec
@var{SpecList} must be ground.  If an existing database is opened and
@var{Mode} is @code{read} or @code{update}, @var{SpecList} is unified
with the db-spec given when the database was created.  If the
unification fails an error is raised.  @var{DBRef} is unified with a
reference to the opened database.  @var{DBName} is not subject to
@code{absolute_file_name/2} conversion.

If @var{Mode} is @code{enumerate} then the indexing specification is not
read, and @var{SpecList} is left unbound.

@code{db_open/5} opens the database in the environment referred to by
@var{EnvRef}.  @code{db_open/4} opens the database outside any
environment.  (@code{db_open/4} is equivalent to calling
@code{db_open/5} with @var{EnvRef} bound to the atom @code{none}.)

To avoid inconsistency, if multiple processes open the same database
with @code{db_open/4} then all of them should do that with @var{Mode}
set to @code{read} or @code{enumerate}.  (This is not enforced by the
system.)

@item db_close(@var{+DBRef})
@findex db_close/1
Closes the database referenced by @var{DBRef}.  Any iterators opened in
the database will be deallocated.  @code{abort/0} does not close
databases.

@item db_current(@var{?DBName}, @var{?Mode}, @var{?SpecList}, @var{?EnvRef}, @var{?DBRef})
@findex db_current/5
Unifies the arguments with the open databases.  This predicate can be
used to enumerate all currently open databases through backtracking.
If the database was opened with @code{db_open/4} then @var{EnvRef} will
be unified with the atom @code{none}.

@item db_store(@var{+DBRef}, @var{+Term}, @var{-TermRef})
@findex db_store/3
Stores @var{Term} in the database @var{DBRef}.  @var{TermRef} is unified
with a corresponding term reference.  The functor of @var{Term} must match
the functor of a spec in the db-spec associated with @var{DBRef}.

@item db_fetch(@var{+DBRef}, @var{?Term}, @var{?TermRef})
@findex db_fetch/3
Unifies @var{Term} with a term from the database @var{DBRef}.  At the
same time, @var{TermRef} is unified with a corresponding term reference.
Backtracking over the predicate unifies with all terms matching
@var{Term}.

If @var{TermRef} is not instantiated then both the functor and the
instantiatedness of @var{Term} must match a spec in the db-spec
associated with @var{DBRef}.

If @var{TermRef} is instantiated, the referenced term is read and
unified with @var{Term}.

If you simply want to find all matching terms, it is more efficient to
use @code{db_findall/5} or @code{db_enumerate/3}.

@item db_findall(@var{+DBRef}, @var{+Template}, @var{+Term}, @var{:Goal}, @var{?Bag})
@findex db_findall/3
Unifies @var{Bag} with the list of instances of @var{Template} in all
proofs of Goal found when @var{Term} is unified with a matching term
from the database @var{DBRef}.  Both the functor and the
instantiatedness of @var{Term} must match a spec in the db-spec
associated with @var{DBRef}.  Conceptually, this predicate is equivalent
with @code{findall(@var{Template}, (db_fetch(@var{DBRef}, @var{Term}, _), @var{Goal}), @var{Bag})}.

@item db_erase(@var{+DBRef}, @var{+TermRef})
@itemx db_erase(@var{+DBRef}, @var{+TermRef}, @var{+Term})
@findex db_erase/2
@findex db_erase/3
Deletes the term from the database @var{DBRef} that is referenced by
@var{TermRef}.

In the case of @code{db_erase/2} the term associated with @code{TermRef}
has to be looked up.  @code{db_erase/3} assumes that the term
@code{Term} is identical with the term associated with @code{TermRef}
(modulo variable renaming).  If this is not the case, the behaviour is
undefined.

@item db_enumerate(@var{+DBRef}, @var{?Term}, @var{?TermRef})
@findex db_enumerate/3

Unifies @var{Term} with a term from the database @var{DBRef}.  At the
same time, @var{TermRef} is unified with a corresponding term reference.
Backtracking over the predicate unifies with all terms matching @var{Term}.

Implemented by linear search---the db-spec associated with @var{DBRef}
is ignored.  It is not useful to call this predicate with @var{TermRef}
instantiated.

@item db_compress(@var{+DBRef}, @var{+DBName})
@itemx db_compress(@var{+DBRef}, @var{+DBName}, @var{+SpecList})
Copies the database given by @var{DBRef} to a new database named by
@var{DBName}.  The new database will be a compressed version of the
first one in the sense that it will not have ``holes'' resulting from
deletion of terms.  Deleted term references will also be reused, which
implies that references that refer to terms in the old database will be
invalid in the new one.

@code{db_compress/2} looks for a database with the db-spec of the
original one.  @code{db_compress/3} stores the terms found in the
original database with the indexing specification @var{SpecList}.
@code{db_compress/2} cannot be used if the database @var{DBRef} was
opened in mode @code{enumerate}.

If the database @var{DBName} already exists then the terms of
@var{DBRef} will be appended to it.  Of course @var{DBName} must have an
indexing specification which enables the terms in @var{DBRef} to be
inserted into it.

In the case of @code{db_compress/3} if the database @var{DBName} does
not exist, then @var{SpecList} must be a valid indexing specification.

@item db_make_iterator(@var{+DBRef}, @var{-Iterator})
@itemx db_make_iterator(@var{+DBRef}, @var{+Term}, @var{-Iterator})
@findex db_make_iterator/2
@findex db_make_iterator/3
Creates a new iterator and unifies it with @var{Iterator}.  Iterators
created with @code{db_make_iterator/2} iterate through the whole database.
Iterators created with @code{db_make_iterator/3} iterate through the terms
that would be found by @code{db_fetch(@var{DBRef}, @var{Term}, _)}.

Every iterator created by @code{db_make_iterator/(2-3)} must be
destroyed with @code{db_iterator_done/1}.

@item db_iterator_next(@var{+Iterator}, @var{?Term}, @var{?TermRef})
@findex db_iterator_next/3
@var{Iterator} advances to the next term, @var{Term} and @var{TermRef}
is unified with the term and its reference pointed to by @var{Iterator}.
If there is no next term, the predicate fails.

@item db_iterator_done(@var{+Iterator})
@findex db_iterator_done/1
Deallocates @var{Iterator}, which must not be used anymore.
@code{abort/0} does not deallocate iterators.

@item db_current_iterator(@var{?DBRef}, @var{?Term}, @var{?Iterator})
@findex db_current_iterator/3
Unifies the variables with the respective properties of the living
iterators.  This predicate can be used to enumerate all currently alive
iterators through backtracking.  If @var{Iterator} was made with
@code{db_make_iterator/2} then @var{Term} will be left unbound.

@section The DB-Spec

A db-spec has the form of a @var{speclist}:

@table @var
@item speclist
= @code{[}@var{spec1}, ..., @var{specM}@code{]}

@item spec
= @var{functor}@code{(}@var{argspec1}, ..., @var{argspecN}@code{)}

@item argspec
= @code{+} | @code{-}
@end table
where @var{functor} is a Prolog atom.  The case @var{N} = 0 is allowed.

A spec @var{F}@code{(}@var{argspec1}, ..., @var{argspecN}@code{)} is
@emph{applicable} to any nonvar term with principal functor
@var{F}/@var{N}.

When storing a term @var{T} we generate a hash code for every applicable
spec in the db-spec, and a reference to @var{T} is stored with each of
them.  (More precisely with each element of the set of generated hash
codes).  If @var{T} contains nonvar elements on each @code{+} position
in the spec, then the hash code depends on each of these elements.  If
@var{T} does contain some variables on @code{+} position, then the hash
code depends only on the functor of @var{T}.

When fetching a term @var{Q} we look for an applicable spec for which
there are no variables in @var{Q} on positions maked @code{+}.  If no
applicable spec can be found a domain error is raised.  If no spec can
be found where on each @code{+} position a nonvar term occurs in @var{Q}
an instantiation error is raised.  Otherwise we choose the spec with
the most @code{+} postitions in it breaking ties by choosing the
leftmost one.

The terms that contain nonvar terms on every @code{+} postition will be
looked up using indexing based on the principal functor of the term and
the principal functor of terms on @code{+} postitions.  The other (more
general) terms will be looked up using an indexing based on the
principal functor of the term only.

As it can be seen, storing and fetching terms with variables on @code{+}
positions are not vigorously supported.
@bye
