Initially, this directory contains

	this README file
	a Makefile
	a bootstrap script named boot_script
	a subdirectory named orig_files
	a subdirectory named examples
	a file installationlog

The orig_files directory contains two subdirs named errors and warnings:
they contains file(s) which are supposed to show every possible error
and warning, when the file is loaded, i.e. compiler warnings/errors.

The examples directory contains a subset of the SICStus examples
directory: some examples don't yet run (or never will). See file
queries for a little bit more info.


This README file is in a directory which is meant to be installed as
<sicstus>/library/chr: the Prolog/CHR files contain no absolute
filenames, but counts on being installed in the chr library.

The whole of the chr package can be regenerated from the files in the
subdirectory orig_files, which contains

	a set of .chr and .pl files 
	a script (named copy_script) for installing some file in ..
	the files copyfromswi and dodif used during development
	subdirectories errors and warnings, with files that together
		generate all possible warnings and errors (except
		the internal ones that shouldn't occur anyway)


The SWI installation bootstraps the compiler and it turned out to be
most convenient to mimick that process in SICStus, instead of porting
only the final outcome.

The .chr and .pl files come in 5 categories:

1) same name as in SWI but rewritten completely

chr_hashtable_store.pl
chr_messages.pl
hprolog.pl (in orig_files, there are two versions: hprolog3.pl and
		hprolog4.pl - according to the SICStus release - comment
		out a line in orig_files/copy_script)


2) same name as in SWI, the same contents, no preprocessing needed

binomialheap.pl
chr_compiler_utility.pl
chr_op2.pl
chr_op.pl
find.pl
guard_entailment.chr
listmap.pl
pairlist.pl


3) same name as in SWI, the same contents, preprocessing needed

a_star.pl
builtins.pl
chr_compiler_options.pl
chr_runtime.pl
chr_swi_bootstrap.pl
chr_swi.pl
chr_translate_bootstrap1.chr
chr_translate_bootstrap2.chr
chr_translate_bootstrap.pl
chr_translate.chr
clean_code.pl

4) new for SICStus

b_globval.pl
hpattvars.pl


5) swi2sicstus.pl which does the preprocessing mentioned in 3 above


Running the preprocessor on files that don't need it, is harmless.

The preprocessing and bootstrapping use a SICStus Prolog system - in
the script, it is reffered to simply as sicstus - adjust to your needs
or define PATH or alias appropriately.


Installing the files
====================

The files that need no preprocessing are simply copied to ..


The other files are preprocessed and the result is copied to a file in
.. with the same name, except chr_swi.pl which is copied to
../../chr.pl.

This is done care by copy_script which is fairly explicit.
Just cd to orig_files and run the script

	cd orig_files
	. ./copy_script


Doing the bootstrap
===================

The current directory contains a script named boot_script.
It is fairly explicit and all you should need to do is

	. ./boot_script

The bootstrap could spit out some warnings, but as long as there are
no errors, or warnings during the loading of the files due to missing
files or conflicts in imported predicates, things are fine.
However, if you get a few times "The module ... is being redefined."
just answer n (I still have to figure out why this is so, but I will look
into it).

The boot process calls sicstus 8 times, most often a run is short -
the total running time is about 160 seconds (on my 500MHz laptop).


Log
===

The file installationlog contains a log of the session during which 
all this was performed.


About the files copyfromswi and dodif used during development
=============================================================

Apart from the files in category 1 and 4 above, you need only a
current version of SWI to start from. The file copyfromswi copies the
necessary files from the distribution: adapt the ORIGIN variable
accordingly.

I use dodif for checking whether I haven't introduced a difference
between local files and the SWI distribution.
